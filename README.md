# GreenThicketLibraryGUMPS
Custom Gumps I made for fun for <b>The Green Thicket Library</b> run by Ahjuna on UOForever Ultima Online Server!

Download the Repository, and extract into C:\Program Files (x86)\UOForever\UO\
If at any time you want to remove the gumps, simply remove the images from that same folder and restart UO.

This will replace your ingame gumps with custom "Green Thicket Library" versions!

All images created using ComfyUI - An open source framework for working
with many of the newest and best Neural Network AI models by the largest
players in the industry such as OpenAI, Meta, HuggingFace, etc. 

Anyone that has a good Nvidia GPU can do this. 1080+, free of charge.

As most Image models require a preset size (typically 512x512 or larger), 
most of the UO artwork is much less than that, we have to upscale
to whatever the closest SDXL resolution is, pass it through the
sampler, and then rescale the output back into the correct size.

The alpha is set and not changed, so all images will retain their dimensions.

I want to point out one thing: Now that we have a workflow in place, 
we can generatea a new set for literally anything we can think of!
Any set of keywords, we can simply pass all of our gump art through 
and get a brand new output! 

"GreenThicketLibraryGUMPSWorkflow" contains the ComfyUI workflow that
anyone can use on their own PC with ComfyUI Portable. Simply
drag that workflow file onto the ComfyUI Web Interface and 
you are good to go!

I use UOFiddler, an free open source software also available on GitHub
to export the current GUMP set from the shard I am currently on.
